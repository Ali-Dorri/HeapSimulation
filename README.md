# HeapSimulation

Simulating heap allocation and deallocation with `malloc` and `free` keywords.

It is not the same with `malloc` and `free` keywords in c++, but it's similar.

`malloc` dedicates a corresponding space in heap.

`free` deallocates the requested size (not the space dedicated for a variable) if exists.
