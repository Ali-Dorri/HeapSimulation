# HeapSimulation

Simulating heap allocation and deallocation with `malloc` and `free` keywords.

It is not the same with `malloc` and `free` keywords in c++, but it's similar.

- `malloc` dedicates corresponding space in heap with requested size.

- `free` deallocates the requested size (not the space dedicated for a variable)  from corresponding bin if any exists.
